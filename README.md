# Offline_Budget_Tracker

## Description

Offline Budget Tracker is an app that works both online and offline. It is a simple to use app that allows a user to type in a transaction name and amount, and either add or subtract the funds from the total amount. If transactions are added while offline, as soon as the user is back online, the transactions will be pulled from cache files and populated online.
